# NewsManagement
The essence of this project is to develop a News Management Application that allows users to view news and filter the preferred news by different categories. Besides, the application provides the admin user to manage news and category information.

News Management Frontend: It is the public-facing area for frontend users and displays
all news. The news portal holds all news (visible for all visitors) and any visitor can view,
search and comment on news.

News Management Admin Console: It is the admin area of the News Management
Application where news and category can be created, edited, or deleted. It holds all the
functionality of management. A registered user/admin (after login) can add/edit/delete
news and category of a piece of news.
